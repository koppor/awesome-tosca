Working group might be renamed as it is not helpful to name it after a certain technology.
Everybody introduced themselfs. Most of attendees are just curious and seem not to really need to work with it
in the near future. 

Diskussion started of what problems should really be solved.
Further information of followup meetings, etc. will be distributed via mail.
